## Installation
- Install docker 
   - Start docker
- Install git
- Git clone
- Configure `.env` using `.env.template`
- Configure `config/nginx` if needed.
- `docker compose up --build`
- `docker compose exec app bash scripts/init_load_data.sh` 
to load init demo db data from fixtures

Script fills db with initial demo data, and it creates
superuser with unsafe password (! do not run script in
production !). Demo images are stored in `static/` so it 
can cause unexpected troubles with deleting or updating.

It is advisable to upload new images using admin panel for
each Image object, and change superuser password.

## Description

![Home](readme_media/home_preview.png)

This is an online store for a seller of board games.

The main element is products, in the form of cards that 
link to detailed pages with product descriptions.

On the main page there are banners of products created by 
the administrator, popular products, limited goods.

![Catalog](readme_media/catalog_preview.png)

The catalog section contains all products, with the 
possibility of filtering and searching, divided into pages.

In the Discounts section, the current discounts are 
indicated, only one, the largest, applies to the product.

On the detailed product page, there are several photos, 
the price including discounts, and reviews with the 
opportunity to leave your own.

There is a possibility of registration on the site. 
This makes it possible to place orders, leave feedback 
and see the order history.

The basket of goods is valid even for unauthorized users, 
when registering, goods from it are transferred to the 
user's basket.

You can place an order from the shopping cart by filling 
in the information fields and confirming.

The completed order can be paid using a third-party payment 
service. At the moment, this feature is not implemented, 
instead there is an imitation of the payment service, 
which fundamentally works in the same way.

The site has an administrative section for content management.
